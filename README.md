# üë®‚Äçüíª SupportNightmares üëª üßü üßõ
A collection of nightmares (unsolved problems / unpleasent experiences / unfair treatments, etc.) generated during interactions with various customer support teams while they were doing their best to solve problems blocking their paying customers from achieveing their goals. The cases are supplemented with proofs and analyses of the interactions.

## Motivation
Unpleasant experiences with various tech support teams motivate the analysis to better understand the factors contributing to these undesriable situations (from the perspective of the paying customer). Only by having a better understanding first, can we come up with ideas on how to counter and solve these meta-issues on top of the underlying issues which triggered the initial support request.
Some relevant factors:
- Power imbalance,
- Abuse of monopolistic advantages,
- Effort required to change cervice provider (customer lock-in),
- Lack of competence at support teams,
- etc.

## Suggestions for improvements / activities to counter unfair treatment of customers
- Customer rights organizations
- etc.

## How to add your contributions

### You can customize the template directories and `.md` files within the [`Template`](./Template/) directory as follows:

**1. Make a copy of the [`YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX`](./Template/YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX) directory and rename it according to the following structure based on your specific details:**
  - `YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX`, where the 3 blocks of information are separated by `_`'s. The 3 blocks are as follows:
    - `YYMMDD`: start date of the support request / nightmare expressed as the last two digits of the year, the month (two digits) and the day (two digits),
    - `NameOfContributor`: your github username,
    - `XXX`: ***number of your previous*** contributions in the given issue category `+ 1` (three digits).
  - *Example: [`250228_drgalapagos_001`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001)*

**2. Use the [`assets`](./Template/YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX/assets) directory inside the [`YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX`](./Template/YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX) directory to share:**
  - Any supporting documents, files, pictures, recordings, etc. that may be relevant for your case.
  - *Example: [`ExampleScreenshot.jpg`](./Template/YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX/assets/ExampleScreenshot.jpg) can be replaced with a screenshot of an event in the process.*

**3. Rename the [`YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX.md`](./Template/YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX/YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX.md) file within the directory using your specific details as defined in Step 1. This will be the main file for the instance of your case containing all the details of the events such as:**
  - Using the structure of the template `.md` file, provide a short summary (~ 1 page) of the entire process at the beginning of this document including:
    - Short description of case providing a big picture,
    - Start date of process / support request,
    - Date of latest update to the request,
    - Number of interactions with support to date,
    - Current status of the case (e.g. unsolved / solved in such and such a way / gave up, etc..).
  - For each message exchange / event you can provide the following details in a short format:
    - Event number,
    - Event date,
    - Event description,
    - Issue with event,
    - Step taken by customer,
    - etc.
  - Use relative links when adding supporting documents.
  - *Example: [`250228_drgalapagos_001.md`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/250228_drgalapagos_001.md) presents a Google Ads Refund Nightmare involving a legitimate automatic refund process blocked by the support team.*

***4. Optional step if you would like to provide an in-depth, subjective analysis of the process:***
 - Rename the [`YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX_analysis.md`](./Template/YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX/YYMMDD_NameOfContributor_XXX_analysis.md) file according to your specific details as defined in Step 1.
 - Use this file for:
   - Analysing the events and your experiences in light of some specific theoretical framework.
 - *Example: [`250228_drgalapagos_001_analysis.md`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/250228_drgalapagos_001_analysis.md) presents a personal analysis of the Google Ads Refund Nightmare using principles from relevant fields of study.*

**5. Place the directories and the `.md` file(s) in the appropriate folder based on the following structure:**
  - **Entities:** these are providers of various services (e.g. companies, organizations, etc.). They represent the top-level organizations that you had an issue with. To solve the issue you encountered you requested help from the support team of one of these entities.
    - If the entity you had an issue with is already present in this directory, choose that one!
    - If the entity is not yet present, add it by defining its name.
    - *Example of an entity: [`Google`](./Entities/Google)*
  - **Sub-units:** the next level represents sub-units within the previous entity such as a branch, department or a smaller unit within the entity.
    - If the sub-unit of the entity you had an issue with is already present in this directory, choose that one!
    - If the sub-unit of the entity is not yet present, add it by defining its name.
    - *Example of a sub-unit within an entity: [`Ads`](./Entities/Google/Ads)*
  - **Issue:** this level represents the general type of your issue.
    - If the general type of issue is already present in this directory, choose that one!
    - If the general type of issue is not yet present, add it by defining its name as succinctly as possible. Use max. 5 words without spaces with the first letter of each word capitalized.
    - *Example of issues: [`Refund`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund), BlockedAccount, DiscrepancyBetweenInstructionsVsInterface, etc.*
  - **Concrete case:** the directory(ies) and `.md` file(s) created in Steps 1-4. describing the process that is worth sharing.
    - Place your directories and file(s) into the appropriate directory representing the general type of issue you tried to solve by asking for help from the support team.
    - *Example of a concrete case where:*
       - *the [`250228_drgalapagos_001`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001) directory of the concrete case contains:*
          - *an [`assets`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/assets) directory for*
             - *supporting documents such as the [`250228_00_01.jpg`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/assets/250228_00_01.jpg) file,*
          - *the main [`250228_drgalapagos_001.md`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/250228_drgalapagos_001.md) file describing events in the case,*
          - *along with the [`250228_drgalapagos_001_analysis.md`](./Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/250228_drgalapagos_001_analysis.md) file focusing on the analysis of the case.*
